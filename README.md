# Pre Work Course

Congratulations! You've begun your journey to become a professional developer. This course is designed to prepare you for the NewForce curriculum so that you can hit the ground running on day one of class.

## Course Objectives

This course will be your introduction to the primary languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This foundation is essential for you to keep pace with the NewForce curriculum.

This course is also designed to give _you_ a sense of what NewForce will be like before you quit your job and commit to a six-month, full-time learning experience.

 Keep the following questions in mind as you go through the course:
1. Do I enjoy coding? Am I curious about and motivated to solve these kinds of problems?
1. Does this style of learning work for me? Can I live without understanding 100% of the things 100% of the time? 

If the answer to any of these questions is anything other than a solid yes, please reach out to one of your instructors. NewForce is not hte only path to becoming a developer and we want to help you figure out if this is the right one for you.
