# The Big Picture

Let's talk about how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a web page. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. HTML is the raw content
    - It contains all the text you see on the page as well as links to other pages and links to images
1. CSS controls how the web page looks
    - This includes page layout, fonts, colors, sizes, etc.
    - Without CSS, every website would look exactly the same: like a boring Word document.
1. JavaScript controls how the web page behaves and responds to users
    - For example: what happens when you click a button, the error messages you get when you try to log into a website with the wrong password, etc.
    - JavaScript can manipulate both HTML and CSS in response to user behaviors
